### Altair (in a nutshell) tutorial 

[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega and Vega-Lite. 
In order to present the ideas of marks and channels, I provide some examples with a jupyter notebook. Bear in mind that this
demo worked with python 3.6, it did not work with python 3.5.2 (although [installation details](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html#dependencies) state that Python 3.5 should be enough)
